      Hi! I'm Jonnier Martinez, originally from Cali, Colombia üá®üá¥. 
      I graduated with an Associate Degree in software analysis and development, 
      specializing in <strong>frontend development applications</strong>.

    </p>

    <p>
      I often attend events as an active member of the <strong>GDG Cali 
        community</strong>  and also actively participate in the <strong>indie creators community</strong>. 
      These spaces allow me to connect with other professionals, learn, and share experiences.

    </p>

    <p>
      One of my standout projects is <strong>Citify</strong>: an academic citation generator that supports over 5 citation styles and has generated over 200 citations so far. It's available in both English and Spanish and was built from scratch using technologies like Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in the field of software development. Feel free to check out Citify and leave me your feedback!
