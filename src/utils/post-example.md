Supervised machine learning, a pivotal branch of artificial intelligence, thrives on labeled data, where each data point is already paired with its correct outcome. This strategic approach empowers machine learning models to accurately predict outcomes for new, unseen data. The utilization of supervised ML spans across an array of critical applications, exemplified by:

The prominence of supervised ML is escalating, mirroring the exponential growth of data accessible to businesses. With this expanding dataset, supervised ML models can be meticulously trained, enhancing their predictive accuracy. Consequently, supervised ML emerges as a paramount tool for robust decision-making across a diverse spectrum of industries.

Illustrating a practical application of supervised ML:

```ts
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' });
}
```

This Python script employs a linear regression model on a dataset, making predictions based on its trained knowledge. The `score()` function quantifies the model's accuracy, providing a valuable metric for evaluation.

As data proliferation continues to be a defining trend for businesses, the role of supervised ML as a pivotal decision-making tool will undeniably strengthen."
